    <h2>Week03</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="week3work/team_assignment_prep.html">Week 3 notes/exercises</a> - Attempted to complete
            the team assignment in preparation for working through it with the team.
            <h3>Questions:</h3>
            <ol>
                 I don't understand why the teacher solution was needlessly complicated for sort exercise 7. <br>
                 Regular sort will already sort text correctly without interference.
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="week3work/team_assignment.html">Week 3 notes/exercises</a> - This week was my
            turn to drive the team assignment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../quiz/index.html">Week 3 notes/exercises</a> - This week I continued following along with the
            code ninja quiz as I completed the readings for each chapter.
            <h3>Questions/Oberservations:</h3>
            <ol>
                There is a lot of useful information in the chapters this week that I will continue to reference.
