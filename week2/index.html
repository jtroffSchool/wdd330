            <a href="week2work/team_assignment_prep.html">Week 2 notes/exercises</a> - Attempted to complete
            the team assignment in preparation for working through it with the team.
            <h3>Questions:</h3>
            <ol>
                How do you make callbacks functional to call multiple functions? 
            </ol>
            <ol>
                The issue I was having was because I was passing the function name as a string. <br>
                Once I removed the quotes I was able to pass the name of the function I wanted. <br>
                This allowed me to use the callback in various ways on my different buttons.
            </ol>

            <a href="../quiz/index.html">Week 2 notes/exercises</a> - This week I got the ninja quiz exercise up to date
            as a review of the things we were learning about.
            <h3>Questions/Oberservations:</h3>
            <ol>
                I didn't know beforehand about using === for a hard comparison of values.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              There was a lot of good review this week as the concepts are familiar but the syntax for javascript is not. <br>
              For example using let instead of var.
            </ol>
        </li>
